## 🏗 Architecture Explanation

The application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The backend handles the data storage and retrieval using MongoDB, while the frontend is responsible for rendering the user interface and making API calls to the backend.

The authentication process is token-based, where JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are generated for authenticated users. The tokens are then checked for requests that require user authentication. The passwords are hashed using bcrypt for secure storage.
